Females typically have two X chromosomes (46,XX), and males usually have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome (46,XY). The SRY gene, normally located on the Y chromosome, provides instructions for making the sex-determining region Y protein. The sex-determining region Y protein causes a fetus to develop as a male. In about 80 percent of individuals with 46,XX testicular disorder of sex development, the condition results from an abnormal exchange of genetic material between chromosomes (translocation).

The mutation related to 46XX testicular disorder of sex development is the disorder of fetal distribution patterning. It occurs when the expression of 46 genes is disrupted in both parents because of defective XX and XY genes. Both the genes with 46XX testicular disorder of sex type develop with two or more, recessive X and XY genes, and one or more XY genes. This situation affects the expression of X and Y genes which is normally transmitted from father to daughter. Because the X and Y genes are transmitted from mother to daughter, only X and Y are passed on. The control of 46 genes can be classified into five different types: 46 type 1 (which usually causes no signaling), 49 type 2 (which causes no signaling) and", "Question: What are the changes related to 46,XX testicular disorder of sex development?

But with all genetic conditions this is the most common one. 46 genes is considered a normal condition. The mutation related to 46XX testicular disorder of sex development is the disorder of fetal distribution patterning. It occurs when a woman is separated from both parents because of defective XX and XY genes. People with 46XX testicular disorder of sex development are treated with two or more recessive X Y genes, and one or more XY genes. This situation occurs due to the expression of X and Y genes that are normally passed on from father to daughter. Because the X and Y genes are often transferred from mother to daughter, the pattern of XX and Y genes are passed on.

Answer:<<<SEP>>>People normally have only two X chromosomes in each cell. Two of the proteins they build on, also known as X and Y, are called sex chromosomes because they help determine whether a person will develop male or female sex characteristics. Females typically have two X chromosomes . Females and males usually have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome (46,XY). The SRY gene, installed on the Y chromosome, provides instructions to generate the sex-determining region Y protein. The sex-determining region Y protein causes a fetus to develop as a male. In about 80 percent of individuals with 46,XX testicular impairments of the condition of sex development, the condition results from an abnormal exchange of genetic material between chromosomes (translocation).

The chromosomal change responsible for the disorder typically occurs as a random event during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) in a parent of the affected individual, usually the mother. Affected individuals have no history of the disorder in their families. An error in cell division called nondisjunction likely results in a reproductive cell containing an isochromosome 12p. If this atypical reproductive cell contributes to the genetic makeup of a child, the child will have two normal copies of chromosome 12 along with an isochromosome 12p. As cells divide during early development, some cells lose the isochromosome 12p, while other cells retain the abnormal chromosome. This situation is called mosaicism.

The diaphragm, which is composed of muscle and other fibrous tissue, separates the organs in the abdomen from those in the chest.

An absent or partially formed diaphragm results in an abnormal opening (hernia) that allows the stomach and intestines to move into the chest cavity and crowd the heart and lungs. This crowding can lead to underdevelopment of the lungs (pulmonary hypoplasia), potentially resulting in life-threatening breathing difficulties that are apparent from birth.

It is believed by many clinicians and parents that if they can correct the problem without surgery, this can lead to a long and successful and happy life, but if the child continues to have the defect, surgery may soon be required. What this means is that the surgery may be successful if nothing else is done and there is no complication, which also can be difficult. This procedure for correcting the diaphragmatostatic defect may result in major pain and/or significant loss, and even complications are rare when they are done properly.

Answer:<<<SEP>>>Congenital diaphragmatic hernia is a defect in the abdomen. The diaphragm, which is composed of fibrous tissue and other fibrous tissue, separates the organs in the abdomen from those in the chest cavity. The development of the diaphragm before birth leads to defects ranging from a thinned area in the diaphragm to its complete absence. An absent or partially formed diaphragm results in a thinning opening (hernia) that allows the stomach and intestines to penetrate the chest cavity and crowd the deep lungs. This crowding can lead to underdevelopment of the jaw lining (or hypoplasia), potentially resulting in life-threatening breathing difficulties that are apparent from birth.

Vitamin K might be necessary to improve the recovery (restores blood and kidney tissue to its proper status) so long as your health is stable and your body is being monitored for the treatment of the condition. Vitamin K deficiency may adversely affect the function of the liver, kidneys, pancreas, adrenals, and possibly other organs.
