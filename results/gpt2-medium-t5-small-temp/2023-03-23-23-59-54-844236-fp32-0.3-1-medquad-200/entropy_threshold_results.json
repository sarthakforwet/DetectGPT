Answer:<<<SEP>>>Spinal cord injuries are classified as either complete or incomplete. An incomplete injury means that the ability of the spinal cord to convey messages to or from the brain is not completely lost. People with incomplete injuries retain some motor or sensory function below the injury. A complete injury is indicated by a total lack of sensory and motor function below the level of injury. People who survive a spinal cord injury will most likely have medical complications such as chronic pain and bladder and bowel dysfunction, along with an increased susceptibility to respiratory and heart problems. Successful recovery depends upon how well these chronic conditions are handled day to day. Surgery to relieve compression of the spinal tissue by surrounding bones broken or dislocated by the injury is often necessary, through timing of such surgery may vary widely. A recent prospective multicenter trial called STASCIS is exploring whether performing decompression surgery early (less than 24 hours following injury) can", "original_crit": 2.9477622509002686, "sampled": "Question: What is the outlook for Spinal Cord Injury?

Partial injuries can arise from damage primarily to nerves, which are only connected to muscles. What causes incomplete injuries? Incomplete spinal cord injuries are a large burden within the medical profession and especially during childhoods. It is believed that the risk of having partial spinal cord injuries continues to rise for the next 25 years. A major increase in the number and severity of these injuries, due to greater frequency of repetitive motion and decreased motor training can cause significant disability, and even death, later in life.

Some of these foods are high in sodium or phosphorus, which people with CKD should limit in their diet. Before making any dietary changes, people with CKD should talk with their health care provider or with a dietitian who specializes in helping people with kidney disease. A dietitian can help a person plan healthy meals. Read more about nutrition for people with CKD on the National Kidney Disease Education Program website.

Answer:<<<SEP>>>A health care provider may advise people with kidney disease to take vitamin K supplements or use a dialysis machine when the condition is poorly controlled. Do not take dialysis if your condition does not respond poorly to dialysis. Vitamin K might be necessary to improve the recovery (restores blood and kidney tissue to its proper status) so long as your health is stable and your body is being monitored for the treatment of the condition. Vitamin K deficiency may adversely affect the function of the liver, kidneys, pancreas, adrenals, and possibly other organs.

Answer:<<<SEP>>>Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) is a condition characterized mainly by a loss of the muscle functions involved in eye and eyelid movement. Signs and symptoms tend to begin in early adulthood and most commonly include weakness or paralysis of the muscles that move the eye (ophthalmoplegia) and drooping of the eyelids (ptosis). Some affected individuals also have general weakness of the skeletal muscles (myopathy), which may be especially noticeable during exercise. Muscle weakness may also cause difficulty swallowing (dysphagia).

Answer:<<<SEP>>>Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEOS) causes loss of function of the left eye. Common side effects include: Pain, difficulty swallowing, blurred vision and/or difficulty seeing in bright light, and temporary vision impairment. CPEOS is a chronic, progressive and life-threatening condition that can arise spontaneously, develop in different combinations during birth, and may require surgical correction. While a number of possible causes, including certain infections (i.e., C. difficile infections), drugs (i.e., ketoconazole, cyclosporine), genetic defects (i.e., Rett syndrome, congenital abnormalities), and environmental exposures are associated with CPEOS, it is often misdiagnosed because of lack of previous clinical evidence. <<see box\n\nRASH, ORTHOPATHY, AND DISEASE",
