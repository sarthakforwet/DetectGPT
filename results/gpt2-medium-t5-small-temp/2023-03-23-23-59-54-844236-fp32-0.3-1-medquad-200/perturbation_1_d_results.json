As fibrosis worsens, cirrhosis that develops in the liver becomes seriously scarred, hardened, and loses function normally. Not every person with cirrhosis has serious cirrhosis, but once serious scarring or cirrhosis is present, few treatments can halt the progression.

However, although heterozygous homocysteine is more common among individuals carrying homocysteine mutant alleles (H/HLF) then other studies have indicated a different risk : individuals carrying the homocysteine mutation variant (H/HLF-2) with some studies reporting an increased probability of cancer would have about a 1 in 1000 chance of developing this disease.

Answer:<<<SEP>>>Hemochromatosis is a disease in which too much iron builds up in your body. Your body needs iron but too much of it is toxic. If you have hemochromatosis, you absorb more iron than you need. Your body has no natural way to get rid of the extra iron. It stores it in body tissues, especially the liver, heart, and pancreas. The extra iron can damage your organs. Without treatment, it can cause your organs to fail. There are two types of hemochromatosis. Primary hemochromatosis is an inherited disease. Secondary hemochromatosis is usually the result of something else, such as anemia, thalassemia, liver disease, or blood transfusions. Many symptoms of hemochromatosis are similar to those of other diseases. Not everyone has symptoms.

The exact underlying cause of bilateral perisylvian polymicrogyria (BPP) is unknown.

The cerebral cortex, is responsible for conscious movement and thought, is one of several deep folds (gyri) corresponding to gyri and gyri (sulci). However, although affected by BPP, the cerebral cortex has an abnormally increased number of gyri that are unusually small.
